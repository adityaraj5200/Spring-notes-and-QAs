### Q1: What is Dependency Injection?
**Answer:** A design pattern where a class receives its dependencies from an external source rather than creating them itself. This promotes loose coupling, testability, and modularity.

**Example:**
```java
@Service
class UserService {
    private final UserRepository repository;
    
    // Constructor injection - dependencies provided externally
    UserService(UserRepository repository) {
        this.repository = repository;
    }
}
```

---

### Q2: What is Inversion of Control (IoC)?
**Answer:** A principle where the control of object creation and dependency management is inverted - instead of your code controlling object creation, a framework or container manages it. This enables features like dependency injection and aspect-oriented programming.

---

### Q3: What is a Bean in Spring?
**Answer:** A bean is an object that is managed by the Spring IoC container. Spring creates, configures, and manages the lifecycle of these objects. Beans can be defined using annotations like `@Component`, `@Service`, or `@Bean` methods.

---

### Q4: What is the difference between @Component, @Service, and @Repository?
**Answer:** All three are specializations of `@Component`:
- `@Component`: Generic stereotype for any Spring-managed component
- `@Service`: Indicates a service layer component (business logic)
- `@Repository`: Indicates a data access component with exception translation

---

### Q5: What is @Autowired annotation?
**Answer:** `@Autowired` tells Spring to inject a dependency automatically. It can be used on constructors, setters, or fields. Spring will find a bean of the required type and inject it.

**Example:**
```java
@Service
class EmailService {
    @Autowired
    private EmailSender emailSender;
}
```

---

### Q6: What is constructor injection and why prefer it?
**Answer:** Constructor injection means dependencies are provided through the constructor. It's preferred because it ensures required dependencies are provided, makes the class immutable, and is easier to test.

**Example:**
```java
@Service
class PaymentService {
    private final PaymentGateway gateway;
    private final Logger logger;
    
    PaymentService(PaymentGateway gateway, Logger logger) {
        this.gateway = gateway;
        this.logger = logger;
    }
}
```

---

### Q7: What are Spring profiles?
**Answer:** Profiles allow you to configure different beans or properties for different environments (dev, test, prod). You can activate profiles using `spring.profiles.active` property.

**Example:**
```java
@Configuration
@Profile("dev")
class DevConfig {
    @Bean
    DataSource dataSource() {
        return new H2DataSource();
    }
}
```

---

### Q8: What is @Value annotation?
**Answer:** `@Value` injects values from properties files, environment variables, or default values directly into fields.

**Example:**
```java
@Component
class AppConfig {
    @Value("${app.name:DefaultApp}")
    private String appName;
    
    @Value("${server.port:8080}")
    private int serverPort;
}
```

---

### Q9: What is @ConfigurationProperties?
**Answer:** Binds external configuration to a Java object, providing type-safe configuration with validation support.

**Example:**
```java
@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "app.mail")
record MailConfig(String host, int port, String username) {}
```

---

### Q10: What is @RestController?
**Answer:** A convenience annotation that combines `@Controller` and `@ResponseBody`. It's used for REST APIs where methods return data that should be written directly to the HTTP response body.

<details>
<summary>What do `@ResponseBody` do?</summary>

`@ResponseBody` in Spring tells Spring MVC:

> ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt render a view ‚Äî instead, take the method‚Äôs return value, convert it to a suitable format (usually JSON or XML), and write it directly to the HTTP response body.‚Äù

---

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Without `@ResponseBody`**

By default, Spring MVC assumes the method returns a **view name** (like `index`, `home`, etc.).

```java
@Controller
public class MyController {

    @GetMapping("/hello")
    public String hello() {
        return "hello"; // Looks for hello.html or hello.jsp
    }
}
```

---

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ With `@ResponseBody`**

Now Spring will:

1. Take the return value.
2. Pass it to an **HttpMessageConverter** (e.g., Jackson for JSON).
3. Write the result directly to the HTTP response body.

```java
@Controller
public class MyController {

    @GetMapping("/hello")
    @ResponseBody
    public String hello() {
        return "Hello, World!"; // Sends plain text as response
    }
}
```

üì§ Output in browser:

```
Hello, World!
```

(No view rendering, no HTML template lookup.)

---

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Common use case: JSON APIs**

```java
@Controller
public class UserController {

    @GetMapping("/user")
    @ResponseBody
    public User getUser() {
        return new User("Alice", 25); // Will be JSON
    }
}
```

üì§ Output:

```json
{"name":"Alice","age":25}
```

*(Assuming Jackson is on the classpath)*

---

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Shortcut: `@RestController`**

Instead of writing `@Controller` + `@ResponseBody` on every method,
use `@RestController` ‚Üí it **implies `@ResponseBody` for all methods**.

```java
@RestController
public class UserController {
    @GetMapping("/user")
    public User getUser() { ... } // auto JSON
}
```

---

‚úÖ **TL;DR:**
`@ResponseBody` bypasses view rendering and sends your method‚Äôs return value straight into the HTTP response body, usually after converting it to JSON or XML.

### Q11: What is @RequestMapping?
**Answer:** Maps web requests to handler methods. It can be applied at class or method level to specify URL patterns, HTTP methods, and other request attributes.

**Example:**
```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/users")
class UserController {
    @GetMapping("/{id}")
    User getUser(@PathVariable Long id) { /* ... */ }
}
```

---

### Q12: What is @PathVariable?
**Answer:** Binds a method parameter to a URI template variable. It extracts values from the URL path.

**Example:**
```java
@GetMapping("/users/{id}/orders/{orderId}")
Order getOrder(@PathVariable Long id, @PathVariable Long orderId) { /* ... */ }
```

---

### Q13: What is @RequestParam?
**Answer:** Binds method parameters to query parameters, form data, or parts of multipart requests.

**Example:**
```java
@GetMapping("/users")
List<User> getUsers(@RequestParam(defaultValue = "0") int page, 
                    @RequestParam(defaultValue = "10") int size) { /* ... */ }
```

---

### Q14: What is @RequestBody?
**Answer:** Binds the HTTP request body to a method parameter. It's commonly used with POST/PUT requests to receive JSON or XML data.

**Example:**
```java
@PostMapping("/users")
User createUser(@RequestBody CreateUserRequest request) { /* ... */ }
```

---

### Q15: What is @Valid annotation?
**Answer:** Triggers validation of the annotated object using Bean Validation annotations like `@NotNull`, `@Size`, etc.

**Example:**
```java
@PostMapping("/users")
User createUser(@Valid @RequestBody CreateUserRequest request) { /* ... */ }

record CreateUserRequest(@NotBlank String name, @Email String email) {}
```

---

### Q16: What is @ExceptionHandler?
**Answer:** Defines a method to handle exceptions thrown by controller methods. It can be used in `@ControllerAdvice` for global exception handling.

**Example:**
```java
@ControllerAdvice
class GlobalExceptionHandler {
    @ExceptionHandler(UserNotFoundException.class)
    ResponseEntity<ErrorResponse> handleUserNotFound(UserNotFoundException ex) {
        return ResponseEntity.status(404).body(new ErrorResponse("User not found"));
    }
}
```

---

### Q17: What is @Transactional?
**Answer:** Declares that a method should run within a database transaction. It provides ACID properties and can be configured with propagation, isolation, and rollback rules.

**Example:**
```java
@Transactional
public void transferMoney(Account from, Account to, BigDecimal amount) {
    from.debit(amount);
    to.credit(amount);
    accountRepository.save(from);
    accountRepository.save(to);
}
```

---

### Q18: What is @Repository?
**Answer:** A stereotype annotation that indicates a class is a data access object. It enables exception translation from database-specific exceptions to Spring's `DataAccessException` hierarchy.

---

### Q19: What is Spring Data JPA?
**Answer:** A Spring module that simplifies data access by providing repository abstractions, query methods, and common data access patterns without writing boilerplate code.

**Example:**
```java
@Repository
interface UserRepository extends JpaRepository<User, Long> {
    List<User> findByEmailContaining(String email);
    Optional<User> findByUsername(String username);
}
```

---

### Q20: What is @Entity?
**Answer:** Marks a class as a JPA entity that maps to a database table. It's used with JPA annotations like `@Id`, `@Column`, and `@Table`.

**Example:**
```java
@Entity
@Table(name = "users")
class User {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;
    
    @Column(nullable = false)
    private String username;
}
```

---

### Q21: What is @Id annotation?
**Answer:** Marks a field as the primary key of an entity. It's required for every JPA entity.

---

### Q22: What is @GeneratedValue?
**Answer:** Specifies how the primary key value should be generated automatically (e.g., auto-increment, sequence, table).

**Example:**
```java
@Id
@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
private Long id;
```

---

### Q23: What is lazy loading vs eager loading?
**Answer:** 
- **Lazy loading**: Associations are loaded only when accessed (default for collections)
- **Eager loading**: Associations are loaded immediately with the parent entity

**Example:**
```java
@OneToMany(fetch = FetchType.LAZY) // Load only when accessed
private List<Order> orders;

@OneToOne(fetch = FetchType.EAGER) // Load immediately
private Address address;
```

---

### Q24: What is N+1 query problem?
**Answer:** A performance issue where fetching a list of entities results in 1 query for the list plus N queries for each entity's associations. It can be solved using fetch joins, `@EntityGraph`, or DTO projections.

---

### Q25: What is @Query annotation?
**Answer:** Allows you to define custom JPQL or native SQL queries for repository methods.

**Example:**
```java
@Query("SELECT u FROM User u WHERE u.active = true")
List<User> findActiveUsers();

@Query(value = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE created_date > ?1", nativeQuery = true)
List<User> findUsersCreatedAfter(Date date);
```

---

### Q26: What is @EnableCaching?
**Answer:** Enables Spring's caching abstraction, allowing you to use caching annotations like `@Cacheable`, `@CacheEvict`, and `@CachePut`.

---

### Q27: What is @Cacheable?
**Answer:** Caches the result of a method invocation. Subsequent calls with the same parameters return the cached result instead of executing the method.

**Example:**
```java
@Cacheable("users")
public User findById(Long id) {
    return userRepository.findById(id);
}
```

---

### Q28: What is Spring Security?
**Answer:** A framework that provides authentication, authorization, and protection against common security vulnerabilities like CSRF, XSS, and session fixation.

---

### Q29: What is @EnableWebSecurity?
**Answer:** Enables Spring Security's web security support and creates a `SecurityFilterChain` bean that can be customized.

---

### Q30: What is @PreAuthorize?
**Answer:** Method-level security annotation that checks authorization before method execution using SpEL expressions.

**Example:**
```java
@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN') or #userId == authentication.name")
public User getUser(String userId) { /* ... */ }
```

---

### Q31: What is CSRF protection?
**Answer:** Cross-Site Request Forgery protection prevents malicious websites from making unauthorized requests on behalf of authenticated users. It's enabled by default in Spring Security for stateful applications.

---

### Q32: What is CORS?
**Answer:** Cross-Origin Resource Sharing allows web applications to make requests to different domains. It's configured to specify allowed origins, methods, and headers.

---

### Q33: What is @EnableAsync?
**Answer:** Enables asynchronous method execution using `@Async` annotation, allowing methods to run in separate threads.

**Example:**
```java
@EnableAsync
@Configuration
class AsyncConfig {}

@Service
class EmailService {
    @Async
    public CompletableFuture<String> sendEmail(String to) { /* ... */ }
}
```

---

### Q34: What is @Scheduled?
**Answer:** Executes a method at fixed intervals or using cron expressions. Requires `@EnableScheduling`.

**Example:**
```java
@EnableScheduling
@Configuration
class SchedulingConfig {}

@Component
class ReportGenerator {
    @Scheduled(fixedRate = 60000) // Every minute
    public void generateReport() { /* ... */ }
}
```

---

### Q35: What is @ConditionalOnProperty?
**Answer:** Conditionally creates a bean based on the presence and value of a configuration property.

**Example:**
```java
@Bean
@ConditionalOnProperty(name = "feature.email.enabled", havingValue = "true")
EmailService emailService() {
    return new EmailService();
}
```

---

### Q36: What is @ConditionalOnClass?
**Answer:** Conditionally creates a bean only if a specified class is present on the classpath.

**Example:**
```java
@Bean
@ConditionalOnClass(name = "com.example.ExternalService")
ExternalServiceClient externalServiceClient() {
    return new ExternalServiceClient();
}
```

---

### Q37: What is @EnableConfigurationProperties?
**Answer:** Enables binding of `@ConfigurationProperties` classes to external configuration.

**Example:**
```java
@EnableConfigurationProperties(MailConfig.class)
@Configuration
class MailConfiguration {}
```

---

### Q38: What is @Configuration?
**Answer:** Indicates that a class contains bean definitions. It's processed by Spring to create and configure beans.

---

### Q39: What is @Bean annotation?
**Answer:** Indicates that a method produces a bean to be managed by the Spring container.

**Example:**
```java
@Configuration
class DatabaseConfig {
    @Bean
    DataSource dataSource() {
        return new HikariDataSource();
    }
}
```

---

### Q40: What is @Primary annotation?
**Answer:** Indicates that a bean should be given preference when multiple candidates are qualified to autowire a single-valued dependency.

---

### Q41: What is @Qualifier annotation?
**Answer:** Specifies which bean to inject when multiple beans of the same type exist.

**Example:**
```java
@Service
class PaymentService {
    private final PaymentGateway gateway;
    
    PaymentService(@Qualifier("stripeGateway") PaymentGateway gateway) {
        this.gateway = gateway;
    }
}
```

---

### Q42: What is @Scope annotation?
**Answer:** Specifies the scope of a bean (singleton, prototype, request, session, etc.).

**Example:**
```java
@Component
@Scope("prototype")
class PrototypeBean {}
```

---

### Q43: What is @PostConstruct?
**Answer:** Marks a method to be executed after dependency injection is complete. It's used for initialization logic.

**Example:**
```java
@Component
class CacheManager {
    @PostConstruct
    public void initialize() {
        // Load initial data into cache
    }
}
```

---

### Q44: What is @PreDestroy?
**Answer:** Marks a method to be executed before the bean is destroyed. It's used for cleanup logic.

**Example:**
```java
@Component
class CacheManager {
    @PreDestroy
    public void cleanup() {
        // Flush cache to disk
    }
}
```

---

### Q45: What is @ControllerAdvice?
**Answer:** A specialization of `@Component` that allows you to handle exceptions across the whole application in one global handling class.

---

### Q46: What is @ModelAttribute?
**Answer:** Binds a method parameter or method return value to a named model attribute, exposed to a web view.

---

### Q47: What is @ResponseBody?
**Answer:** Indicates that a method return value should be bound to the web response body.

---

### Q48: What is @ResponseStatus?
**Answer:** Maps an exception or controller method to an HTTP status code.

**Example:**
```java
@ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.CREATED)
public void createUser() { /* ... */ }
```

---

### Q49: What is @EnableJpaRepositories?
**Answer:** Enables JPA repositories and configures the base packages to scan for repository interfaces.

---

### Q50: What is @EnableTransactionManagement?
**Answer:** Enables Spring's annotation-driven transaction management capability, allowing the use of `@Transactional` annotation.
